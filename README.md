# Testing-with-Jest
We will use Jest to do some unit testing. Few things are needed here:
* Node.js
* npm (node package manager)
* VS Code

# Instructions
* Create a folder with any file name you choose to give but make sure it ends with '.js' to let VS Code know we are going to use JavaScript.
* Now open a new terminal and check to see if you have Node.js installed. Use this command:
```node --version```
* If Node.js is not installed then got this website https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and choose the recommended options. I personally chose version 19.
* After installing it, go back to VS code and verify by using the above command.
* Now check for ```npm``` by using this command:
```npm --version```
* By installing Node.js, npm should be installed.
* Now check to see if Jest is installed by using this command:
``` jest --version```
* If not installed we will use npm to install it since Jest needs node.js to run and npm is a way to install node modules. Use this to add a package.json file:
```npm init -y```
  * This ```-y``` is useful for automatically answering 'yes' to all questions the ```initi``` will ask.
